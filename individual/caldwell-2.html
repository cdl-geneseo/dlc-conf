<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Two non-traditional learners will share their stories of transition
into fully online, asynchronous digital learning experiences. Key
factors for overcoming challenges in confidence, belonging, and
technical &amp; digital fluency included time, communication, and
understanding expectations. The instructor will share strategies to
support learner’s transition by connecting course content to authentic
contexts, mastery learning, and designing and sequencing learning
processes.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>Teaching and learning online is a collaborative, creative, and
stimulating endeavour and can be highly effective. However, for older,
professional, non-traditional learners, new ways of learning, novel
teaching approaches, and innovative uses of digital media in online
courses can be intimidating and may affect their confidence and sense of
belonging. While non-traditional students bring rich and extensive lived
experiences, both professional and personal, along with specialized
technical skills to the university classroom, these may not be
immediately applicable in unfamiliar environments such as online,
asynchronous classes. Non-traditional learners may also have notions of
teaching and learning based on more traditional experiences and be
reluctant to seek assistance, struggle with the fear of being seen as
not being able to “keep up” and the fear of failure. Leaders of Distance
Education can ease the struggles and fears, aiming to build confidence
within these students.</p>
<p>Our presentation shares the experiences of 2 highly successful,
non-traditional professional students, newly enrolled in a fully online
asynchronous masters of business program, who faced challenges using
digital tools and completing unfamiliar learning activities and
assignments in their initial semesters. Personal challenges included
shaky confidence and low sense of belonging with fear of being in ‘over
their head’. The instructor, who had also been a non-traditional higher
education student, came to learn that when there are clear expectations,
open lines of communication, opportunities for mastery learning, and an
emphasis on the process of learning, online education flourishes for
everyone. Over time, the students came to trust the process (based also
on evidence-based adult learning principles), embrace vulnerability,
strengthen their confidence and sense of belonging, and approach
learning with authenticity and an emphasis on progress over perfection.
Their course work is now shared with others in the form of tips &amp;
guidance as well as exemplars.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of the session, participants will learn (1) perspectives
from highly capable learners who face confidence &amp; belonging
challenges, (2) instructional strategies to support learners’
transition, including mastery learning, generative learning, and
strategic communication Presenter Headshot</p>

children and involved in community service such as the Potsdam Rotary,
the St. Lawrence Leadership Institute, the local PTA, and the
Parishville Rescue Department. Professionally, Tanya is an Associate

<p>In 2013, Tanya earned her Bachelor’s of Business Administration
degree as a non-traditional student from SUNY Canton where she first
experienced online learning in its early stages. Wanting to pursue her
dream of obtaining a master’s degree, yet knowing the challenge it would
be as a single mother working full-time, she set out on her journey to
find a program that aligned with her needs and schedule. In Spring 2021,
she enrolled in her first semester at SUNY Potsdam in the fully online,
asynchronous Master’s of Business program and expects to graduate in May
2023.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Conners-Chamberlain</strong> is currently a Graduate
student with SUNY Potsdam, in the Organizational Leadership &amp;
Business track. She is a college and career specialist with the Saint
Regis Mohawk Tribe. Over the past twenty-five years, she has worked as
an advocate and volunteer in her community of Akwesasne and a recent
empty nester, having successfully raised two exceptional daughters who
are now living their best lives. Along with being a parent, her life
experiences and career journey have given her the knowledge to become a
valuable leader in her community. Melissa has decided it is time to
achieve some of the goals that she has put on hold as she dedicated her
life to others. During her first semester of Graduate school, she felt
completely lost with the new technologies that were required to use in
the courses. She really struggled and continues to face difficulties
navigating the technological world that did not exist when she attended
college during the years of 1993-1997.</p>
