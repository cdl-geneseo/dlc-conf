<p>Jill and Karen will share processes and products of e-portfolio learning and assessment activities in an online, asynchronous course. Jill will share her communication strategy that identified an audience, format, goals, and intended audience response. Karen will share learning activities, assignments, and adult learning principles underpinning the design of the e-portfolio course work, including lessons learned and ongoing use cases.</p> <h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2> <p>e-Portfolios are a student-centered, multi-dimensional and empowering learning activity and authentic assessment. When e-portfolios are embedded in a semester-long course and designed according to evidence-informed learning &amp; assessment principles, students have the time, safe space, and learning community to plan, design, and craft their digital identity and connect their learning to both career management and lifelong learning. This student &amp; faculty team will share the process and product of e-portfolios in a graduate business program where learners first make sense of course content, engage in the class learning community to connect course content to their lived experience and to authentic contexts including their own professional lives within the “safe space” of the learning management system (LMS). Students evaluate course content and display it in a digital form for a targeted audience, personalizing the format. With this engagement, feedback, and the opportunity to iterate, students then create public-facing materials in their own website or e-book for a designated audience and purpose.</p> <h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2> <p>By the end of the session, participants will learn: (1) adult learning principles related to e-portfolios; (2) learning &amp; assessment activities for embedding e-portfolios in course work, and (3) free apps and tools to support e-portfolio development</p> <h2 id="co-presenter-bio">Co-Presenter Bio</h2> <p>Jill Benedict is the Executive Director of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Gaming Commission and a member of the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe.
