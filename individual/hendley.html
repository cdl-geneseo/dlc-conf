<!-- "Between Paper and Pixels - Building Community during COVID : SUNY Oneonta's Pandemic Diary as Blog and Book" --> <ul> <li>Friday, November 4, 2022</li> <li>3:00 PM - 3:30 PM</li> </ul> <h2 id="speaker">Speakers</h2> <p><strong>Matthew Hendley</strong>, <strong>Ann Traitor</strong>, and <strong>Darren Chase</strong></p> <h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2> <p>This presentation will examine the cross-disciplinary teamwork behind the creation of a pandemic blog and book based on the experiences of the SUNY Oneonta community during the COVID pandemic between Spring 2020-Spring 2021. It will reflect on the technical, emotional and editorial challenges of creating a living archive, historical record and medium for community self-reflection and expression during a crisis.</p> <h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2> <p>This presentation is an analysis of the process and outcomes of creating a blog and later a book based upon the experience of the SUNY Oneonta campus community during the peak of the COVID pandemic between Spring 2020-Spring 2021.</p> <p>The presentation will show the importance of cross-disciplinary teamwork that allowed an initial paper-based class assignment centered on students’ COVID pandemic experiences to grow into a blog which included photographs, poetry, diaries and reflections by SUNY Oneonta staff, faculty and students. SUNY Oneonta’s Pandemic Diaries Project was inspired by Mass Observation, a maverick experiment launched in Britain during the 1930s to gather written public observations of everyday life. Mass Observation has become an invaluable set of primary sources for researchers trying to delve into the social history of Britain between 1937-50.</p> <p>Highlighted in the presentation will be the ability of History faculty, a library director and a digital instructional course designer to work seamlessly together to grow the project. Our presentation will show how the team tackled technical challenges, encouraged submissions and edited entries to present the blog as a living archive which encouraged a sense of community during a moment of crisis for our campus. SUNY Oneonta was the only school in the state that had to send home all its students twice due to COVID (actions which gathered international media attention).</p> <p>From the original blog project, the Pandemic Diaries Project team signed a book contract with SUNY Press (forthcoming 2023). The book will include over 200 edited blog entries through which the grief, frustration, fear, resilience and life changes of this tumultuous period are laid bare. The book also includes chapters with historical comparisons between the pandemic diaries and the UK Mass Observation experience, themes which recur in the blogs and reflections on the nature of digital humanities and the evolution of the project. The presentation will also reflect on the challenges and opportunities of converting the unstructured digital blog into a book. It will show how the decision to make the book available through multiple formats (including open access) will further enrich historical understanding of this unique moment in time. Finally, it will also reflect upon the different forms of community building and understanding that are possible in either a raw blog form or a historically framed publication such as our book. The presentation highlights conference themes of underrepresented voices, open pedagogy and building confidence.</p> <h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2> <p>At the end of the session, participants will learn of the use of a campus wide blog and its conversion into a book manuscript to nurture a sense of campus community and connection as well as prompt self-reflection by the SUNY Oneonta community during the COVID crisis of 2020-2021.
