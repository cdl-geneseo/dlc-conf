<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>I will present a beta-version of an interactive web resource that
examines an archive of Time magazine containing 3,389 issues ranging
from 1923 to 2014, focusing on images of faces. The website, Faces in
Time, will provide visitors with a set of tools with which to explore
our data and our research findings.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>This is an examination of an archive of Time magazine containing
3,389 issues ranging from 1923 to 2014, focusing on images of faces. We
extracted 327,322 faces from the archive, categorized all of them by
gender, and obtained detailed characteristics of a subset of 8,789 of
those faces.</p>
<p>Our research explores relationships between images and their
corresponding socio-political contexts. For example, in one published
study, our analysis revealed that the percentage of faces that present
as female was closely aligned with larger currents in women’s history
and the history of feminism . Specifically, we found that the percentage
of female face images peaked as women became more active in public life,
and waned in eras characterized by anti-feminist backlash. We also noted
a change in tone and content as Time, from the 1970s onwards, began
hiring and promoting more women as writers, photographers, and editors.
This is one of several findings.</p>
<p>We seek to disseminate our findings to broader audiences through a
web-resource with interactive visualizations that allow visitors to
explore the faces, as well as the trends in the metadata that we
extracted from the faces. The proposed website, Faces in Time, will
provide visitors with a set of tools with which to explore our data,
analysis, and findings. Digital platforms afford readers the ability to
interactively re-contextualize images in a way that encourages critical
thinking, positioning them as investigators rather than passive
consumers of visual and media culture.</p>
<p>In this interactive presentation, I invite the audience to engage
with a beta version of the Faces in Time website. I will present 4
visualizations, describe the design rationale of each, and allow time
for the audience to interact with the site to provide feedback.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2>
<p>Participants will engage with a new web resource that is in
development, and will have the opportunity to provide feedback for
improving the design. Presenter Headshot Biography Ana Jofre is an

digital humanities, with a particular interest in creating aesthetic
informative web resources.</p>
