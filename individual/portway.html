A faculty will share their pedagogical practices, tips, tools, and lessons learned while teaching the project. A former student will share their retrospective perspective, emphasizing the career-readiness competencies they gained or struggled with throughout the semester.</p> <p>The project was delivered online twice (Spring 2021 and Fall 2021) in an upper-level fashion promotion course at the State University of New York at Oneonta. At the beginning of the course, students are given a brief from Scott Saltzman of PUMA (SUNY Oneonta alum, class of 1986). The brief contains proprietary information with only minor modifications for use in the classroom, and it covers the next season’s upcoming products. Students are asked to design a viable, persuasive, and well-researched promotional campaign for the product launch. Students had frequent networking opportunities with an industry professional and worked with an authentic brand’s upcoming products, and launch dates. Students executed the same tasks as the promotion professionals at PUMA, from developing concept boards and mock-ups, identifying needed resources, creating a timeline and list of functions, and developing a highly detailed and itemized budget. Students present sections of their promotional idea pitch twice during the semester and receive detailed written and verbal feedback from the professor and our partner at PUMA. Students apply their feedback and significantly revise their promotional campaign before delivering their final pitch instead of a written exam.</p> <p>This presentation is significant because it addresses student perspectives on best practices in the classroom. Further, experiential learning projects are excellent preparation for careers after college (Franek, 2019). This project asks students to cultivate the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) career readiness core competencies (What Is Career Readiness?, 2022) such as professionalism, communication, critical thinking, technology, and teamwork to complete high-quality collaborative projects on time.</p> <p>Participants will leave the presentation with sample project briefs, project tracking resources, self-and-peer evaluation forms, guidance, and insight on executing experiential team projects in an online learning modality. Participants will also see anonymous course evaluation data and hear from a student who completed the course in the fall of 2021.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <ul> <li>Franek, R. (2019).

She worked in the fashion industry for ten years at brands such as Burberry and Le Chateau before completing her Master’s in Fashion at Ryerson University (’12) and her Ph.D. in Fiber Science and Apparel Design at Cornell University (’18). Dr. Portway’s research has historically focused on the efficacy of sustainable fashion activism, and recent work has been concerned with best practices to cultivate career readiness in the classroom. Recent scholarly contributions include teaching resources such as case studies for the Bloomsbury Fashion Business Cases and a research paper presented at the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) concerning ePortfolios class projects and career readiness. Dr. Portway is experienced with a wide range of high-impact pedagogical practices, as defined by the AAC&amp;U, such as capstone projects, collaborative projects, ePortfolios, internships, and writing-intensive coursework.
