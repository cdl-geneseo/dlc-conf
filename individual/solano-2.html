<p>If you have wondered what the “buzz” is all about with digital
badging and micro-credentialing, join this session to learn more about
them and how to get started using digital badges in your courses. We
will also discuss the differences between them and discover several
ideas for designing micro-credentials in your department.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>Micro-credentials have gained momentum over the last decade. With so
many jobs requiring technical skills and due to the nature of technology
growing so quickly, there has become a need to provide mini-courses that
will deliver just-in-time training without the obligations and time
commitment of earning a full degree. Many working adults, as well as
those re-entering the job market, require training to demonstrate
competency, demonstrate their skills, or learn new ones through
micro-credential courses. In the realm of higher education, many
universities are already supplementing their existing degrees by
offering additional micro-credential courses that current students,
alumni, and the public can complete and earn a micro-credential that is
verified by the university. Most micro-credentials also issue digital
badges that can be displayed in a digital portfolio and used for a
variety of professional uses. There is a multitude of ways to structure
a micro-credential, but a good way to get started with them is by
learning about digital badges. In this session, you will learn what
digital badges are and strategies for integrating them into your
teaching. Digital badging is an informal method of micro-credentialing
that is still valuable to students and helps them to build their
professional portfolios. If you have wondered what the “buzz” is all
about with digital badging and micro-credentialing, join this session to
learn more about them and how to get started. Plan for Session</p>
