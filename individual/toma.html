In our proposed model, these will serve as constructs, or latent variables that influence students’ social capital (another latent and our dependent variable). In addition, we are taking concepts from the community of inquiry framework, community of practice, epistemic engagement, transformative learning and identity construction, and emotional management theory to propose a new and improved Community Engagement Framework that can more closely identify the elements leading to students’ perceptions of social capital. To do so, we are bringing in a myriad of indicator variables that can potentially measure or influence the latent independent variables from the model as well as our dependent variable – students’ social capital. We also look to measure students’ sense of belonging and community in online learning environments.</p> <p>At this stage, this research is theoretical in nature, but our intention is utilizing this new model to survey online students to cross-validate our framework with path analysis and structural equation modeling. We also plan to survey online instructors to identify practice-based use of the engagement constructs that we propose. Results from both studies will assist colleges, universities, and course instructors to design and deliver online courses that facilitate increased learner engagement and empower students to build confidence and resilience throughout the online learning process.</p> <h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2> <p>By the end of the session, participants will be well versed in the contemporary literature in distance education and will find themselves intrigued by our proposal to create a new form of online learning (which is classically asynchronous) that is closer to hybrid. Research shows that hybrid learning has better learning outcomes, and we posit that it also leads to better engagement and increased social capital and students’ sense of belonging.</p> <h2 id="co-presenter-bio">Co-Presenter Bio</h2> <p>Matthew Berge is a SUNY 2021-22 PRODiG Scholar close to completing his MA degree in Social and Public Policy.
