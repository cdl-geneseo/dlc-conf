<p>Dr. Travis Matteson Assistant Professor Ignite Session 1</p>
<h3 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h3>
<p>This presentation discusses digital tools to help students engage
with Indigenous histories and communities, with the goal of exploring
the cultural importance of land, disrupting the myth of the “vanishing
Indian,” and developing a digital advocacy mapping project.</p>
<h3 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h3>
<p>“Firsting and lasting,” according to Jean O’Brien, is a narrative
construct used by New England colonists to write American Indians out of
local histories. By honoring the “firsts” of the colonists (schools,
founders) and elegizing Indian “lasts,” local historians effectively
narrated the myth of Indian “extinction” despite the persistence of
local Indigenous populations.</p>
<p>This presentation discusses tools to help students identify and
respond to examples of “firsting and lasting” in their local
communities. Though O’Brien’s research focus is southern New England,
students find that there is ample evidence of this narrative construct
in New York’s local histories. In a class called “Global Perspectives,”
I first introduce the context of Land Acknowledgments using a variety of
print and video examples. From this foundation, I ask students use the
Native Land digital map to identify and discuss the Indigenous
territories on which they live, study, and work. Then, students search a
database of New York State historical markers for their hometown using
search terms like “first” and “Indian” and reflect on their findings.
Finally, students work together to develop infographic maps that
acknowledge the history of “firsting and lasting” and advocate for
engagement with their local Indigenous histories, cultures, and
communities.</p>
<h3 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this session, participants will learn how to access
digital tools for mapping Indigenous history in their local
communities.</p>

<p>Teach Your Students to Fish: Open-Source in the Classroom</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-1">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Where do open-source tools fit in a classroom? This session explores
the balance between open-source tools and closed platforms, and how the
impact they have on the learning environments we create for
students.</p>
<h3 id="full-abstract-1">Full Abstract</h3>
<p>Where do open-source tools fit in a classroom? Closed platforms and
tools are typically designed to be easy to use above all else, while
open-source tools often require students to dig into the details and
learn new skills to make the most of them. The costs of these tradeoffs
are not always immediately obvious, and striking an appropriate balance
can be difficult to do. This session will focus on how those tradeoffs
often play out in the classroom, and offer strategies to encourage the
adoption of open-source tools that can empower your students.</p>
<h3 id="session-objectives-1">Session Objectives</h3>
<p>Throughout this session, participants will: 1. Reflect on the tools
students are asked to use 2. Examine the relationship they have with
those tools, and what effect that relationship has on student
learning</p>

<p>Mr. Michael Panetta Educational Technologist Stories from the Front:
Empire State College’s Experience with the LMS Transition</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-3">Brief Description</h3>
<p>This session is a partial deconstruction of the processes that Empire
State College developed and executed as part of the LMS transition, with
respect to the pedagogical and practical implications of such a move. It
is an unvarnished view into the high points and low of the transitional
period as a member of Cohort One.</p>
<h3 id="full-abstract-3">Full Abstract</h3>
<p>Cohort One is in the middle of its first term with Brightspace as its
new learning management system. Though the transition has been
successful in some ways, in other ways Empire State College has seen a
great level of pushback from all user groups, from faculty and adjuncts
to professional staff to the students whose experience in the LMS is
formative for their education. The purpose of this presentation is to
present to the SUNY community Empire’s experiences with the transition
and, in doing so, provide the campuses that are to start their
transition as part of the next cohorts as well as organizations outside
the SUNY aegis with a clear view of what to expect, what mistakes we
made while doing so, and what we did to remediate them. It is our goal
to also provide similar feedback to the SUNY administration as well, for
the purposes of streamlining the administrative process as well as
provide potential solutions to problems in the process that we, at
Empire State College, discovered along the way.</p>
<p>This presentation combines observations made by the various
technology and instructional design departments represented in Empire
State College along with user anecdotes about their use and experiences
within Brightspace. It is an unvarnished view into our campus’s world
after transition to assist and provide context for campuses awaiting the
start of the transition process. Processes to follow through on,
processes to avoid, and so on. Plan for Session</p>
<h3 id="session-objectives-3">Session Objectives</h3>
<p>At the end of this session, participants will: - Understand the
processes developed by Empire State College to transition the campus to
a new LMS. - Make connections between policies developed by their home
campuses and Empire State College to determine best practices for LMS
transition. - Develop best practices for the transition of student and
instructor data to a new system.</p>

<p>Asking Asynchronous Students: What more would you like in your
courses? Investigating learning preferences in the online asynchronous
classroom</p>
<h3 id="brief-description-4">Brief Description</h3>
<p>Two professors serving on an assessment team explore these questions:
How to offer more to asynchronous students, to ensure their full
learning experience? What is recommended to faculty seeking to increase
interaction? What do asynchronous students seek in terms of live
(synchronous) sessions, professor recordings, and live face-to-face
meetings? From the viewpoint of assessment, what faculty offerings
provide assessment gains?</p>
<h3 id="full-abstract-4">Full Abstract</h3>
<p>Asking Asynchronous Students: What more would you like to see in your
courses? Investigating student learning experiences and preferences in
the asynchronous classroom</p>
<p>The evolution of education in the digital age provides newly
developed modes of teaching that must be assessed to facilitate an
environment that is conducive to learning. Not only must we prepare
students for the field we are teaching, but we must also have knowledge
of what students expect from their classes.</p>
<p>Understanding classroom modality preferences, including student needs
in synchronous online classroom is critical in providing the tools
necessary for student success. This incorporates the opportunities of
synchronous lectures, recordings, one-to-one meetings with their
Professor. This study investigates both online and traditional classroom
student preferences for lectures and classroom meetings.</p>
<p>What do asynchronous students really want for their learning
experiences? How can dedicated professors deliver the content that
asynchronous students value. Do students really watch the videos
offered? Some professors report adding optional synchronous sessions.
These are not scheduled during registration, but are delivered at a
mutually convenient time. One issue is what to call these class meeting
sessions in the async environment: drop-ins, meet and greets, group
study sessions, bonus material ?</p>
<p>The College of Business at SUNY POLY offers MBA and MS Accounting
degrees in the asynchronous (all online) format. A promise is made to
the student that no meetings at a certain time will be required. In
contrast, undergraduate business and accounting degrees classes are
offered in two distinct formats: traditional in-class and online
asynchronous. Students select a format and are to stay with that
format.</p>
<p>Faculty assessment discussions have asked these questions: How to
offer more to asynchronous, to ensure a full learning experience?</p>
<p>One specific recommendation is for each professor to include a course
COMMUNICATION plan in the syllabus along with the typical office hours.
This lists and offers to students a range of ways to receive substantive
engagement and feedback. Here, the optional synchronous offerings can be
listed.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what do asynchronous students seek in terms of live
(synchronous) sessions, professor recordings, and live face-to-face
meetings? From the viewpoint of assessment, what faculty offerings
provide assessment gains? This presentation will offer our questions,
our exploration and conversations with our students, and make
recommendations to those interested in student-centered learning.</p>
<h3 id="session-objectives-4">Session Objectives</h3>
<p>Consider student preferences for increased interaction with faculty.
