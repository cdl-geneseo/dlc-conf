<p><strong>The WordPress Dashboard Tells Its Own History - close reading a user interface</strong></p>
<h2 id="brief-description">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Across 20 slides, I will show how the WordPress administrative interface or "dashboard" tells its own history, once you look closely and consider the metaphors employed by the software, itself. A guided ‘close reading’ of WordPress helps students learn, contextualize the software, and explore with greater confidence.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>WordPress was originally released on May 27, 2003, which means parts of that software are as old or older than many of our incoming students at Muhlenberg College. The longevity and evolution of WordPress attests to its usefulness. But this should also caution against making broad assumptions of prior knowledge or technical understanding when introducing WordPress to new users, especially college-aged or younger ones.</p>
<p>Across twenty slides, I will demonstrate how the WordPress administrative user interface, like nearly every site of human/computer interaction, contains a telling of its own genesis, developmental history, markers of its iterative development, and in the case of WordPress its open source (F/LOSS) roots.</p>
<p>This close reading of the WordPress administrative interface helps students (new to WordPress) better understand the purpose of the software. A guided reading of WordPress’s affordances also helps students remember and contextualize its many features as they consider their own needs and projects. This framing of user interfaces as bounded, material things with tangible analogs helps demystify them and builds student confidence. Lastly, presenting WordPress as software shaped over time by input from the WordPress community helps illustrate the nature and relative advantages of F/LOSS.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives">Session Objectives</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>By the end of this Ignite session, participants will experience a quick "close reading" of a user interface.</li>
<li>Participants will be prompted to consider how a guided close reading of WordPress will help students to better understand the software’s affordances, and what the software means to accomplish.</li>
<li>Participants will be challenged to introduce new software (new to students) by locating analogs, tangible precedents, or mental models that help illustrate the material nature of that digital tool.</li>

<p><strong>Helping students build digital fluency and other transferrable skills in a business ethics course using a hands-on collaborative multimedia project</strong></p>
<h2 id="brief-description-1">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Showcase of a collaborative scaffolded multimedia assignment that emphasizes experiential learning, guides students as they learn to apply ethical analysis to a business ethics case, and helps them develop digital fluency and other practical skills and career readiness competencies.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract-1">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>One common complaint among undergraduates is that they are often required to take certain humanities courses that they see as not contributing any useful skills toward their career readiness. Putting aside the utility of general knowledge and critical thinking skills often gained from taking these courses, there is a way to integrate useful practical skills and professional competencies — such as digital fluency, communication, and collaboration — into a humanities course without compromising its integrity. During my “ignite” session I plan to showcase a collaborative scaffolded multimedia assignment that represents a major assessment in my business ethics course and emphasizes experiential learning. For this assignment, teams of students research and create an original business ethics case study, which they produce as a YouTube video using one of three formats. The assignment is set up to teach students the basics of project management as they are guided through a series of tasks from brainstorming through co-production to completion. Stand-up meetings, in-person check-ins, and weekly reports and deliverables are built into this project. Teams discuss and choose collaboration and communication technology and methods. They also evaluate different technologies that they can use to produce their multimodal artifacts, learn how to use them, and upload their videos to YouTube. During this project, students develop valuable and highly transferrable skills, such as digital communication, media research, technology assisted co-production, and others. Furthermore, all this hard and soft skill development is happening while students are actually engaging with course subject matter on a deeper level and applying what they have learned as part of their ethical analysis.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives-1">Session Objectives</h2>
<p>During this session, participants will</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Explore an example of an assignment in a humanities (business ethics) course that integrates experiential learning, digital fluency, and other practical skills with research and analysis that are often emphasized in humanities;</li>
<li>Consider creating scaffolded multimedia assignments in their own courses. Presenter Headshot</li>

<p><strong>The Flipped Classroom: Online</strong></p>
<h2 id="brief-description-3">Brief Description</h2>
<p>Moving the flipped classroom online takes dedication to the new way of thinking and teaching. This ignite session is geared towards giving information about what the flipped classroom is, its benefits and how it can look in an online setting.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract-3">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>When educators went through an extremely sudden shift to online virtual classes, many lost the engaging nature of the flipped classroom and reverted back to lecture-style teaching. This ignite session is focused on the benefits of the flipped classroom approach and how to successfully incorporate it into an online teaching modality.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives-3">Session Objectives</h2>
<p>At the end of this session, participants will understand what the flipped classroom looks like in an online real. Participants will discuss how they can adjust their classroom to reflect the flipped classroom basics and participants will assess the benefits of the flipped classroom.</p>

<p>Strategies to support neurodiverse students with ADHD in Higher Education.</p>
<h2 id="full-abstract-4">Full Abstract</h2>
<p>Students with diverse learning needs are becoming more prevalent in higher education institutions. There has been a substantial rise in the number of adult learners with ADHD (American College Health Association, 2020). To ensure the support and achievement of neurodiverse learners, especially higher education students with AHDH, higher education faculty should implement strategies within their courses to support all learners. One framework frequently utilized in K-12 settings is Universal Design for Learning (UDL). UDL provides access to content by focusing strategies on engagement, various means of displaying content, and supporting learners in demonstrating their learning in a way that best supports their learning needs (CAST, 2018). Specific UDL strategies that would have a positive impact on learners with ADHD are discussed.</p>
<h2 id="session-objectives-4">Session Objectives</h2>
<p>In this session participants will</p>
<ul>
<li>learn characteristics of ADHD in adult learners</li>
<li>learn strategies for teaching neurodiverse adults in higher education.</li>
