The poster also offers viewers evidence-based best pedagogical practices for ePortfolio assignments that have been refined over multiple course offerings.</p><h2 id="full-abstract">Full Abstract</h2><p>This research poster describes a case study of student perceptions about their career readiness after completing an ePortfolio capstone assignment in an upper-level fashion journalism course at the State University of Oneonta.</p><p>The ePortfolio assignment was first developed and assigned in Fall 2020 and was revised as a result of this research during the subsequent course offering in Spring 2022. The assignment had two components. First, students reflected on detailed feedback provided by the professor and revised the eight articles they were assigned throughout the semester. Next, students prepared a professional, public-facing ePortfolio suitable for job searches using WordPress instead of a final exam.</p><p>This assignment allowed students to practice the career readiness competencies defined by the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE), such as professionalism, communication, critical thinking, technology, and career and self-development (What Is Career Readiness?, 2022). Further, in the fashion industry, portfolios are required for many job and internship searches, and online formats have become the industry norm. Additionally, students are more motivated to craft ePortfolios over paper-based ones (Driessen et al., 2007).</p><p>Seven students participated in semi-structured interviews in December 2021, approximately nine months after completing the assignment the first time it was offered. Interview questions were designed to reflect the NACE core competencies and asked upper-level students and new alum about their perceived career readiness as a result of completing the assignment. Emergent themes were identified and coded in Atlas.Ti using grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967) and suggested the assignment was excellent career preparation. Key results indicated that students had established a more professional digital presence (7 participants, grounded 10 times), enhanced their confidence to learn new technology (5 participants, grounded 6 times), and most had already used their portfolio in a job or internship search (5 participants, grounded 10 times).</p><p>This research is significant because it offers insight into student perceptions of career readiness after completing an ePortfolio assignment and evidence-based best pedagogical practices refined over multiple course offerings.</p><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li>Driessen, E.

Students used digital tools and open-access maps to maximize community engagement and effectively communicate sustainable initiatives with the Village Board and wider community.</p><h2 id="full-abstract-1">Full Abstract</h2><p>Service-learning projects are designed to tie course learning outcomes to service experiences in order to benefit both the students and the community partners. Students and a faculty member from SUNY Delhi’s 300-level Sustainable Design and Planning course will co-present a poster that shares a service-learning project completed in Spring 2022 in partnership with the Village of Delhi. In phase one of this project, students completed a site analysis, reviewed existing planning reports, and surveyed the community about their goals and needs. Free digital tools (like PIXLR and GoogleEarth) were used to document and help visualize the complex analysis, and public data and maps from sources like the EPA, DEC, FEMA, NRCS were analyzed. Students met with the mayor and members of a local organization to assess their needs and goals tied to sustainable planning. The students created and distributed surveys to collect community feedback and also created a QR code linked survey that they distributed through posters, social networks, and the village website. This digital collection was beneficial to improve community participation in this work, especially during the pandemic. Survey data were compiled and analyzed.</p><p>In phase 2, students developed a list of sustainable initiatives that could be feasible based on the site analyses and community feedback. Each student then researched and developed rough estimates for two initiatives, explaining how each proposal tied to the three spheres of sustainability (economy, society, and the environment). Images of comparable precedents were provided to help community members visualize the proposals.</p><p>Finally, students created a digital presentation shared at a Village Board Meeting, and submitted a complete report to the mayor. Seeking to diversify the outreach, students created a walking tour free to the whole community to share their proposals and build excitement for sustainable planning. Feedback forms were used to seek community prioritization of the initiatives.</p><p>The project was well-received by the community, was featured in both local papers, and the students’ final report won an award at SUNY Delhi’s 2022 Student Achievement Day. Students appreciated the ability to apply what they were learning in the classroom with a real community, to learn about the processes of planning through experience, and to participate in civic engagement in this community.</p><p>This poster will be graphic-rich and share the methodology, digital tools, and beneficial outcomes of this service-learning project. Challenges, limitations, and future plans will also be covered.</p><h2 id="objectives-1">Objectives</h2><ol type="1"><li>From this poster presentation, participants will be able to describe the methodology and list some digital tools used in a service-learning project to boost community participation, communicate complex analyses, and to assist in the visualization and assessment of proposed initiatives.</li><li>From this poster presentation, participants will be able to understand the benefits, challenges, and limitations of this service-learning project.</li></ol><h2 id="biography-1">Biography</h2><p>Lisa Tessier is a Professor in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at SUNY Delhi.

Assistant Professor</p><p><strong>How digital tools enabled interdisciplinary service learning: A collaboration between the Cooperstown Graduate Program and the Little Falls Historical Society</strong></p><h2 id="brief-description-3">Brief Description</h2><p>For a service learning course in collaboration with the Little Falls Historical Society, a combination of digital tools has not only made it possible to continue the collaboration through the pandemic, but has also enhanced the outcomes of its open pedagogy through connecting course content to students’ professional online presence, offering open access and visibility of their work</p><h2 id="full-abstract-3">Full Abstract</h2><p>The Cooperstown Graduate Program strives to offer real world experiential learning in all areas of museum work. While physical presence and social interaction within an exhibition space are essential to the museum experience, and therefore to teaching and learning museum studies, digital tools have proven to play an important part to complement and enhance the student experience and learning on our program. Science Cabinet of Curiosities is an interdisciplinary course taken in the last semester of our 2-year program. For students of the science track it is the capstone course in which they bring together ideas and skills gathered throughout the program. Since 2020 the course is taught as a service learning collaboration with the Little Falls Historical Society and their museum. Needless to say, when the covid 19 pandemic forced us to find alternatives to our regular visit to the museum to work with their collection, the completion of the course and the continuation of the collaboration was made possible by the availability of videoconferencing tools. But digital tools have become an essential part of the course beyond that. The possibility of online open access publishing of what was initially planned as a physical book not only provided an alternative to printing and publishing the book when funds from grants that had already been awarded and committed were withdrawn retroactively, but contributed to increase the visibility of the students’ work and to enhance their online professional profiles. Subsequent runs of the course have continued to benefit from digital tools, as the output of the course became an audio tour of selected buildings and sites of Little Falls. From the creation of the audio tracks to making them available to the public through a digital interface, the project would just not have been possible without the appropriate digital tools. In addition, the Little Falls Historical Society has given us the honor of having a section of their website dedicated to the contributions of our students, which is a wonderful repository and showcase of this successful partnership.</p><h2 id="objectives-3">Objectives</h2><p>At the end of this session, participants will have learnt how digital tools can become an essential part of and enhance an experience that hinges on the physical.</p><h2 id="biography-3">Biography</h2><p>Erik Stengler is Assistant Professor for the Science Museum Studies Track at the Cooperstown Graduate Program, situating science museums, science centers and planetariums in the wider context of science communication. Stengler is committed to the idea that science museums need to incorporate a new generation of museum professionals with a solid grounding in museum studies to ensure that these institutions remain relevant to society in the 21st century.</p><p>Stengler has extensive experience in science museum education, programming, exhibition design and outreach, having led several large publicly funded projects to take museum activities to underserved communities, including remote islands, prisons, senior citizens and hospitals; or unexpected places, like beaches, music festivals, fun fairs and village squares. In 2020 Stengler introduced a new interdisciplinary service learning course in collaboration with the Little Falls Historical Society. A combination of digital tools has not only made it possible to continue the collaboration through the pandemic, but has also enhanced the outcomes of its open pedagogy through connecting course content to students’ professional online presence offering open access and visibility of their work on a dedicated section on the website of the Little Falls Historical Society.</p><h2 id="presenter-4">Presenter</h2><p><strong>Samantha Alberts</strong><br />

Student</p><p><strong>Utilizing Instagram to Strategically Plan, Execute, and Build a Brand Image for an Academic Program</strong></p><h2 id="brief-description-5">Brief Description</h2><p>The purpose of the independent study and Instagram page was to inform and connect with current students, faculty, alumni, and prospective students about all things Fashion and Textiles. The presentation will illustrate the effort that goes into planning each post, while showing various analytics and content, along with the mistakes that were made along the way.</p><h2 id="full-abstract-5">Full Abstract</h2><p>Do social media platforms, such as Instagram, provide a unique opportunity for college programs to connect with their students (prospective and current), faculty, and alumni? If so, what are the best practices that can guide the creation of an engaging Instagram page for an academic program in a university? These are the questions that the authors of this project sought out to answer. Most top universities in the country, both private and public, have Instagram accounts. They even run separate pages for individual academic programs and that is what the authors of this project explored by creating an official Instagram page for SUNY Oneonta’s Fashion and Textiles program in the Human Ecology department.</p><p>The purpose of the Fashion and Textiles Instagram page (<span class="citation" data-cites="fashion_sunyoneonta">@fashion_sunyoneonta</span>) was to inform and connect with current students, faculty, alumni, and prospective students about all things Fashion and Textiles. To accomplish this, the student presenter of this project ran the page under the guidance of the faculty member in the program through an independent study course. The objective of this presentation is to share the strategy employed to develop a successful Fashion and Textiles Instagram page with the intention of providing a model for future students, faculty, or staff who may take over the operations of the page. This presentation is also intended to serve as a model for other academic programs that wish to set up and run an official Instagram account.</p><p>In this presentation, the authors will go into detail on how they used programs such as Excel and Canva to create and organize weekly posts for the Instagram page. The presentation will illustrate the effort that goes into planning each post, while showing various analytics and content, along with the mistakes that were made along the way. One major accomplishment of running this page was learning the proper communication skills it takes to run a social media account for an academic program. The page also prides itself on gaining 205 followers in just 13 months. The Fashion and Textiles page also has a certified account following the page, this account is Fantastic Fungi from the hit documentary on Netflix “Fantastic Fungi.” The evolution and accomplishments of the page in just a year had surpassed all expectations, but the greatest accomplishment has been being able to showcase how incredible the Fashion and Textile program, students and faculty at SUNY Oneonta really are.</p><h2 id="objectives-5">Objectives</h2><ol type="1"><li>How to create their own social media account for an academic program.</li><li>The importance of tracking social media data in order to fabricate content that will create engagement with current, and prospective students.
